This project is developed under Eclipse using 
Web Tools Platform (http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/).

This small web demonstration is powered by 
lift framework (http://liftweb.net).

Since lift is changed dramatically from release to release 
you should use the lift version mentioned in this file.

You need to register Apache Tomcat 5.5 Server under name "tomcat5.5"
(Window>Preferences>Server>Installed Runtimes)

In order to develop/build this project using Eclipse 
you following third party libraries (jar-files) are placed
into /hosc_web/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib:

lift-webkit-0.9.jar           (http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases/net/liftweb/lift-webkit/0.9/)
log4j-1.2.15.jar              (http://logging.apache.org/log4j/)
commons-fileupload-1.2.1.jar  (http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/)

Since new scala plugin (2.7.2RC1) supports projects dependencies 
and eclipse web tools can export project as war file the recommended way to
package this project is to export it as war-file. 
Select project in project explorer, Export>Web>War file. All dependencies
(including scala libraries) will be packaged automatically.

Please note that scala libraries will be taken from scala plugin.

build.xml is considered to be obsolete.
