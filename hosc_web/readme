Since new scala plugin supports projects dependencies 
and eclipse web tools can export project as war file the recommended way to
package this project is to export it as war-file. 
Select project in project explorer, Export>Web>War file. All dependencies
(including scala libraries) will be packaged automatically.

Please note that scala libraries will be taken from scala plugin.
