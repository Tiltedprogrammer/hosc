This project is developed under Eclipse using Web Tools Platform (http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/).

This small web demonstration is powered by lift framework (http://liftweb.net).

Because this project is open source one and of small size it seems to be illogical
to place third-party libraries inside this project.

Since lift is changed dramatically from release to release you should use the lift version mentioned in this file.

You need to register Apache Tomcat 5.5 Server under name "tomcat5.5" (Window>Preferences>Server>Installed Runtimes)

In order to build/develop this project using Eclipse you need to place following libraries (jar-files)
into /hosc_web/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib:

scala-library.jar                  (http://scala-lang.org)
lift-webkit-0.7.jar                (http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases/net/liftweb/lift-webkit/0.7/lift-webkit-0.7.jar)
log4j-{version}.jar                (http://logging.apache.org/log4j/)
